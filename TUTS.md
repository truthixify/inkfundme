# Building a Crowdfunding dApp with Ink! Smart Contracts and React/Next.js

Hi there! In this tutorial, Iâ€™ll guide you through building a decentralized crowdfunding platform from the ground up. Think of it as us coding together over a coffee. Iâ€™ll explain each step, highlight important choices, and make sure you understand not just how but also why weâ€™re doing things. If some parts feel challenging, donâ€™t worry, just follow along and everything will click as we go.

Weâ€™ll be working with the Ink!FundMe smart contract on the Passet Hub testnet, using the Polkadot API (PAPI). To get started quickly, weâ€™ll base our project on the Inkathon boilerplate. By the end, youâ€™ll have a working dApp where users can create campaigns, make contributions, and explore more advanced features. You can grab the starter code here: [inkfundme](https://github.com:truthixify/inkfundme.git).

## Project Overview  

Weâ€™ll be building **Ink!FundMe**, a crowdfunding dApp powered by ink! contracts and a React/Next.js frontend.  

At a high level, the project consists of:  
- **Ink! smart contract**: Defines campaigns, tracks contributions, and enforces rules.  
- **React/Next.js frontend**: Lets users create and explore campaigns through a modern interface.  
- **Polkadot API (PAPI)**: Connects the contract to the frontend.  
- **Netlify hosting**: Makes the app accessible to anyone.  

Picture this: users can launch campaigns for causes they care about, while contributors browse, donate, and track progress. The smart contract guarantees transparent rules, and the frontend makes the experience intuitive.  

---

## Prerequisites  

Before starting, make sure you have these installed:  

- **Rust/ink!** â€“ for writing and compiling smart contracts.  
- **React/Next.js** â€“ for the frontend.  
- **TypeScript** â€“ for type-safe frontend development.  
- **Node.js (v18 or later)** â€“ required runtime for Next.js.  
- **Bun** â€“ package manager and dev server.  
- **Pop CLI** â€“ tool for compiling and deploying ink! contracts.  
- **Polkadot.js extension** â€“ browser wallet for interacting with the testnet.  
- **GitHub** â€“ for managing the repo.  
- **Netlify** â€“ to host the frontend.  

ðŸ‘‰ If youâ€™re missing any, install them before continuing.

## Diving into the Smart Contract

### Token Contract Integration

The Ink!FundMe contract integrates with an ERC20 token contract (`INKFUNDME`) for all financial transactions, ensuring modularity and reusability. Key features of the token contract include:
- **Standard ERC20 Functions**: `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, and `allowance`.
- **Minting**: A `mint` function for distributing test tokens via a faucet.
- **Events**: Emits `Transfer` and `Approval` events for off-chain tracking.
- **Access Control**: In production, the `mint` function should include access controls.

The token contract is deployed separately, and its address is passed to Ink!FundMe during initialization.

### Core Data Structures

#### Campaign Structure

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
#[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "std", derive(StorageLayout))]
pub struct Campaign {
    pub id: u32,                  // Unique campaign identifier
    pub title: String,            // Campaign title
    pub description: String,      // Detailed campaign description
    pub goal: U256,               // Funding goal in tokens
    pub deadline: u64,            // Campaign end timestamp
    pub owner: Address,           // Campaign creator's address
    pub raised: U256,             // Total funds raised
    pub completed: bool,          // Whether the campaign is finalized
}
```

**Design Choices**:
- `U256` for token amounts ensures compatibility with EVM standards and handles large numbers.
- `deadline` uses `u64` for Unix timestamps (seconds since epoch).
- `completed` flag prevents multiple finalizations.

#### Contract Storage

```rust
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct InkFundMe {
    token_contract: TokenRef,     // Reference to the ERC20 token contract
    campaigns: StorageVec<Campaign>, // Dynamic array of campaigns
    contributions: Mapping<(u32, Address), U256>, // (campaign_id, contributor) â†’ amount
    next_campaign_id: u32,        // Auto-incrementing campaign ID
}
```

**Storage Optimization**:
- `StorageVec` is gas-efficient for storing campaigns.
- `Mapping` enables constant-time lookups for contributions.
- `next_campaign_id` ensures unique campaign identifiers.

### Key Contract Functions

#### Query Functions

These functions allow the frontend to read campaign and contribution data:

```rust
/// Get campaign details by ID
#[ink(message)]
pub fn get_campaign(&self, campaign_id: u32) -> Result<Campaign> {
    if campaign_id >= self.campaigns.len() {
        return Err(Error::CampaignNotFound);
    }
    Ok(self.campaigns.get(campaign_id).unwrap())
}

/// Get all campaigns
#[ink(message)]
pub fn get_all_campaigns(&self) -> Vec<Campaign> {
    let mut campaigns = Vec::new();
    for i in 0..self.campaigns.len() {
        if let Some(campaign) = self.campaigns.get(i) {
            campaigns.push(campaign);
        }
    }
    campaigns
}

/// Get contributor's contribution amount for a specific campaign
#[ink(message)]
pub fn get_contribution(&self, campaign_id: u32, contributor: Address) -> U256 {
    self.contributions.get((campaign_id, contributor)).unwrap_or_default()
}

/// Get the ERC20 token address
#[ink(message)]
pub fn get_token_address(&self) -> AccountId {
    self.token_contract.account_id()
}

/// Get total number of campaigns
#[ink(message)]
pub fn get_campaign_count(&self) -> u32 {
    self.campaigns.len() as u32
}
```

#### Campaign Creation

```rust
#[ink(message)]
pub fn create_campaign(
    &mut self,
    title: String,
    description: String,
    goal: U256,
    deadline: u64,
) -> Result<u32> {
    if goal == U256::zero() || deadline <= self.env().block_timestamp() {
        return Err(Error::InvalidParameters);
    }
    let campaign_id = self.next_campaign_id;
    let owner = self.env().caller();
    let campaign = Campaign {
        id: campaign_id,
        title,
        description,
        goal,
        deadline,
        owner,
        raised: U256::zero(),
        completed: false,
    };
    self.campaigns.push(&campaign);
    self.next_campaign_id += 1;
    self.env().emit_event(CampaignCreated { id: campaign_id, owner, goal, deadline });
    Ok(campaign_id)
}
```

**Security Considerations**:
- Validates inputs to prevent invalid campaigns.
- Uses `env().caller()` for ownership tracking.

#### Contributing to a Campaign

```rust
#[ink(message, payable)]
pub fn contribute(&mut self, campaign_id: u32, amount: U256) -> Result<()> {
    let campaign = self.get_campaign_mut(campaign_id)?;
    let caller = self.env().caller();
    if campaign.completed {
        return Err(Error::CampaignCompleted);
    }
    if self.env().block_timestamp() > campaign.deadline {
        return Err(Error::DeadlineReached);
    }
    self.token_contract.transfer_from(caller, self.env().account_id(), amount)?;
    campaign.raised = campaign.raised.checked_add(amount).ok_or(Error::Overflow)?;
    let contribution = self.contributions.get((campaign_id, caller)).unwrap_or(U256::zero());
    self.contributions.insert((campaign_id, caller), &(contribution + amount));
    self.env().emit_event(ContributionMade { campaign_id, contributor: caller, amount });
    Ok(())
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Uses checks-effects-interactions pattern for reentrancy protection.
- Employs safe math to prevent overflows.
- Emits events for off-chain tracking.

#### Finalizing a Campaign

```rust
#[ink(message)]
pub fn finalize(&mut self, campaign_id: u32) -> Result<()> {
    let campaign = self.get_campaign_mut(campaign_id)?;
    if self.env().caller() != campaign.owner {
        return Err(Error::OnlyOwner);
    }
    if campaign.completed {
        return Err(Error::CampaignCompleted);
    }
    if self.env().block_timestamp() <= campaign.deadline {
        return Err(Error::DeadlineNotReached);
    }
    campaign.completed = true;
    let success = campaign.raised >= campaign.goal;
    if success {
        self.token_contract.transfer(campaign.owner, campaign.raised)?;
    }
    self.env().emit_event(CampaignFinalized { campaign_id, success });
    Ok(())
}
```

**Patterns Used**:
- Access control via owner checks.
- State machine pattern for campaign lifecycle.
- Event-driven architecture for updates.

#### Claiming a Refund

```rust
#[ink(message)]
pub fn claim_refund(&mut self, campaign_id: u32) -> Result<()> {
    let campaign = self.get_campaign_mut(campaign_id)?;
    let caller = self.env().caller();
    if !campaign.completed {
        return Err(Error::CampaignNotCompleted);
    }
    if campaign.raised >= campaign.goal {
        return Err(Error::CampaignSuccessful);
    }
    let contribution = self.contributions.get((campaign_id, caller)).unwrap_or(U256::zero());
    if contribution == U256::zero() {
        return Err(Error::NoContribution);
    }
    self.contributions.insert((campaign_id, caller), &U256::zero());
    self.token_contract.transfer(caller, contribution)?;
    self.env().emit_event(RefundClaimed { campaign_id, contributor: caller, amount: contribution });
    Ok(())
}
```

**Security Considerations**:
- Ensures campaign is completed and unsuccessful before allowing refunds.
- Verifies contributor has a non-zero contribution.
- Clears contribution record after refund to prevent double-claiming.

## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up the Inkathon Boilerplate

Clone the Ink!FundMe repository, based on the Inkathon boilerplate:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:truthixify/inkfundme.git
cd inkfundme
bun install
```

The project structure includes:
- `contracts/`: Ink!FundMe and ERC20 token contracts, plus deployment scripts.
- `frontend/`: React/Next.js app for contract interaction.

Start the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This launches the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 2. Deploy the Contracts

The repository includes a deployment script (`contracts/scripts/deploy.ts`) to deploy the ERC20 token and Ink!FundMe contracts. If using pre-deployed contracts, skip to the frontend configuration.

#### Deployment Script

The `deploy.ts` script automates contract deployment:

```typescript
import { contracts } from "@polkadot-api/descriptors";
import { deployContract } from "./utils/deploy-contract";
import { initApi } from "./utils/init-api";
import { writeAddresses } from "./utils/write-addresses";
import { type FixedSizeBinary } from "polkadot-api";

const main = async () => {
  const initResult = await initApi();
  const deployTokenResult = await deployContract(initResult, "token", contracts.inkfundme_token, "new", {
    name: "INKFUNDME",
    symbol: "IFM",
    decimals: 0,
    initial_supply: [1000000000000n, 0n, 0n, 0n],
  });
  const deployInkFundMeResult = await deployContract(initResult, "inkfundme", contracts.inkfundme, "new", {
    token_address: FixedSizeBinary.fromHex(deployTokenResult.evmAddress),
  });
  await writeAddresses({ token: deployTokenResult, inkFundMe: deployInkFundMeResult });
};

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error(error);
  process.exit(1);
}).finally(() => process.exit(0));
```

**Key Features**:
- **Initialization**: Connects to the target chain (e.g., Passet Hub or `dev`) via `initApi`.
- **Token Deployment**: Deploys the ERC20 token with name `INKFUNDME`, symbol `IFE`, 0 decimals, and 1 trillion tokens.
- **Ink!FundMe Deployment**: Deploys Ink!FundMe, linking it to the token contract.
- **Address Storage**: Saves EVM and SS58 addresses to `contracts/deployments/`.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `CHAIN`: Target chain (default: `dev`).
  - `ACCOUNT_URI`: Deployment account (default: `//Alice` or `.env.<chain>` or `.env`).
  - `DIR`: Output directory for deployment files (default: `./deployments`).

**Usage**:
1. Build contracts and generate TypeScript bindings:
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   bun run build
   bun run codegen
   ```
2. Fund your account with test tokens using the [Passet Hub Faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/?parachain=1111).

3. Configure your .env like this:
   ```bash
   ACCOUNT_URL=your-account-uri
   CHAIN=passetHub
   ```

4. Add passetHub RPC
   ```bash
   bunx papi add -w wss://testnet-passet-hub.polkadot.io passetHub
   ```

5. Deploy:
   ```bash
   bun run deploy
   ```

**Example Output**:
```bash
âœ” Initialized chain 'passethub' with account '5Grw...'
âœ” Deployed contract 'token' at address '5GRs...' (0xc113f...)
âœ” Deployed contract 'inkfundme' at address '5HkH...' (0xfb5e...)
âœ” Exported deployment info to 'deployments/token/passethub.ts'
âœ” Exported deployment info to 'deployments/inkfundme/passethub.ts'
```

#### Configure the Frontend

Update `frontend/src/lib/inkathon/deployments.ts` with the deployed addresses:

```typescript
import { contracts } from "@polkadot-api/descriptors";
import * as inkFundMePassetHub from "@inkathon/contracts/deployments/inkfundme/dev";
import * as tokenPassetHub from "@inkathon/contracts/deployments/token/dev";

export const token = {
  contract: contracts.inkfundme_token,
  evmAddresses: { passethub: tokenPassetHub.evmAddress },
  ss58Addresses: { passethub: tokenPassetHub.ss58Address },
};

export const inkFundMe = {
  contract: contracts.inkfundme,
  evmAddresses: { passethub: inkFundMePassetHub.evmAddress },
  ss58Addresses: { passethub: inkFundMePassetHub.ss58Address },
};
```

### Interacting with the Contract

Now comes the fun partâ€”**connecting the frontend to your FundMe contract**.  

The structure is straightforward:  
- `app/pages` â†’ route-based pages  
- `components` â†’ reusable UI elements  
- `hooks` â†’ blockchain interaction helpers  
- `utils` â†’ formatting, address handling, and other helpers  

For blockchain interactions, we rely on hooks like:  
- `useTypedApi` â†’ access the Polkadot API (PAPI)  
- `useChainId` â†’ detect the active chain  
- `useSignerAndAddress` â†’ access the connected wallet and signer  

The frontend itself uses **`@polkadot/api`** together with React hooks to handle contract interaction.  

:::note  
For queries that **just display data** (like the funding goal or total raised), you donâ€™t actually need a wallet connection. However, because ink! contract `.query` calls require an `origin`, youâ€™ll often run into cases where the signer address isnâ€™t available yet.  

To work around this, you can:  
1. Use **Alice (`//Alice`)** as a default pre-mapped account for queries.  
2. Or skip `.query` entirely and fetch state directly from storage.  
:::  

---

### Querying Contract Data  

There are two main ways to read contract state:  

#### **Option 1: Query Storage Directly (Simple & Read-Only)**  

Best for global values that donâ€™t depend on a user account:  

```ts
// Query storage directly
const storageResult = await contract.getStorage().getRoot()
const newState = storageResult.success ? storageResult.value : undefined
setFundMeState(newState)

#### 1. Querying Campaigns (Storage Query)

Fetch all campaigns directly from storage:

```typescript
const [campaigns, setCampaigns] = useState<Campaign[]>();
const api = useTypedApi();
const chain = useChainId();

const fetchCampaigns = useCallback(async () => {
  if (!api || !chain) return;
  const sdk = createReviveSdk(api as ReviveSdkTypedApi, inkFundMe.contract);
  const contract = sdk.getContract(inkFundMe.evmAddresses[chain]);
  const storageResult = await contract.getStorage().getRoot();
  if (storageResult.success) {
    setCampaigns(storageResult.value.campaigns);
  }
}, [api, chain]);
```

#### 2. Querying Contributions (Message Call)

Fetch a user's contribution to a campaign:

```typescript
const { signerAddress } = useSignerAndAddress();
const api = useTypedApi()
const chain = useChainId()
const [contribution, setContribution] = useState<FixedSizeArray<4, bigint>>();

const fetchContribution = useCallback(async (campaignId: number) => {
  if (!api || !chain || !signerAddress) return;
  const sdk = createReviveSdk(api as ReviveSdkTypedApi, inkFundMe.contract);
  const contract = sdk.getContract(inkFundMe.evmAddresses[chain]);
  const isMapped = await sdk.addressIsMapped(signerAddress);
  if (!isMapped) {
    toast.error("Account not mapped. Please map your account first.");
    return;
  }
  const result = await contract.query("get_contribution", {
    origin: signerAddress,
    data: { campaign_id: campaignId, contributor: ss58ToEthereum(signerAddress) },
  });
  if (result.success) {
    setContribution(result.value.response);
  }
}, [api, chain, signerAddress]);
```

#### 3. Creating a Campaign

```typescript
export function CreateCampaignForm({ onCampaignCreated }) {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ title: "", description: "", goal: "", deadline: "" });
  const api = useTypedApi();
  const chain = useChainId();
  const { signer, signerAddress } = useSignerAndAddress();

  const handleCreateCampaign = useCallback(async () => {
    if (!api || !chain || !signer || !signerAddress) return toast.error("Connect wallet.");
    setIsLoading(true);
    try {
      const sdk = createReviveSdk(api as ReviveSdkTypedApi, inkFundMe.contract);
      const contract = sdk.getContract(inkFundMe.evmAddresses[chain]);
      const goalU256 = [BigInt(Math.floor(Number(formData.goal))), 0n, 0n, 0n];
      const deadlineTimestamp = BigInt(Math.floor(new Date(formData.deadline).getTime() / 1000));
      const tx = contract.send("create_campaign", {
        origin: signerAddress,
        data: { title: formData.title, description: formData.description, goal: goalU256, deadline: deadlineTimestamp },
      }).signAndSubmit(signer);
      await tx; // Simplified; full promise handling in repo
      onCampaignCreated();
      toast.success("Campaign created!");
    } catch (error) {
      toast.error("Failed to create.");
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  }, [api, chain, signer, signerAddress, formData, onCampaignCreated]);

  // Form UI: Inputs for title, desc, goal, deadline, and Create button
  // Full JSX in repo
}
```

#### 4. Contributing to a Campaign

```typescript
const handleContribute = useCallback(async () => {
  if (!api || !chain || !signer || !signerAddress || !contributionAmount) return;
  setIsContributing(true);
  try {
    const sdk = createReviveSdk(api as ReviveSdkTypedApi, inkFundMe.contract);
    const contract = sdk.getContract(inkFundMe.evmAddresses[chain]);
    const amountBig = BigInt(Math.round(Number(contributionAmount) * 10 ** tokenInfo.decimals));
    const amountU256 = [amountBig, 0n, 0n, 0n];
    const tx = contract.send("contribute", {
      origin: signerAddress,
      data: { campaign_id: campaignId, amount: amountU256 },
    }).signAndSubmit(signer);
    await tx;
    toast.success("Contributed!");
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error("Failed.");
  } finally {
    setIsContributing(false);
  }
}, [api, chain, signer, signerAddress, contributionAmount, campaignId, tokenInfo]);
```

#### 5. Finalizing and Refunding
The finalization and refund follows similar patterns to contribute. Check repo for `handleFinalize` and `handleClaimRefund`. They send `finalize` or `claim_refund` with `campaign_id`.

#### 6. Example Component: ContractCard

A card listing campaigns (simplified):

```typescript
export function ContractCard() {
  const [campaigns, setCampaigns] = useState<Campaign[]>([]);
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);
  // ... hooks

  // fetchCampaigns as above

  useEffect(() => { fetchCampaigns(); }, [fetchCampaigns]);

  if (isLoading) return <CardSkeleton />;

  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader><CardTitle>Ink!FundMe Campaigns</CardTitle></CardHeader>
      <Table>
        <TableBody>
          {campaigns.map((campaign) => (
            <TableRow key={campaign.id}>
              <TableCell>{campaign.title}</TableCell>
              <TableCell>{campaign.raised[0].toString()} / {campaign.goal[0].toString()} IFE</TableCell>
              <TableCell>
                {/* Input and Contribute button, wired to handleContribute */}
              </TableCell>
            </TableRow>
          ))}
        </TableBody>
      </Table>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

## Deployment to Netlify

To share your dApp, deploy the frontend to Netlify:

1. **Build the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   bun run build
   bun run export
   ```
   This generates a static site in `frontend/out/`.

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Sign in to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and select "New site from Git."
   - Connect your GitHub account and choose the `truthixify/inkfundme` repository.
   - Set build settings:
     - Build command: `cd frontend && bun run build && bun run export`
     - Publish directory: `frontend/out`
   - Deploy the site. Netlify provides a URL (e.g., `https://inkfundme.netlify.app`).

3. **Test the Deployed App**:
   - Visit the Netlify URL and connect your Polkadot.js wallet.
   - Verify interaction with the Passet Hub testnet.
  
---

### Next Steps and Challenges

Enhance the dApp with:
### 1. Gas Optimization  

- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple contributions in one transaction.  
- **Storage Optimization**: Use `Lazy` for large or rarely accessed data structures.  
- **Event Indexing**: Implement custom indexing for efficient off-chain querying.  

### 2. Security Considerations  

- **Reentrancy Protection**: Follow the **checks â†’ effects â†’ interactions** pattern.  
- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access controls to restrict sensitive operations.  
- **Input Validation**: Validate all external inputs (amounts, addresses, asset IDs).  
- **Error Handling**: Return clear errors without exposing internal logic.  

3. **Multi-Asset Support**:
   - Update `Campaign` to support multiple assets:
     ```rust
     #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
     #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)]
     pub struct Asset {
         pub asset_id: u32,            // 0 for native token, >0 for Asset Hub assets
         pub min_contribution: Balance, // Minimum contribution
         pub max_contribution: Option<Balance>, // Optional max contribution
     }
     #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
     #[ink::scale_derive(Encode, Decode, TypeInfo)]
     pub struct Campaign {
         // Existing fields...
         pub accepted_assets: Vec<Asset>, // List of accepted assets
         pub goals: Mapping<u32, Balance>, // Asset ID to target amount
     }
     ```
   - Add asset selection in the frontend.
   - Integrate price oracles for value conversion.

4. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Add milestone-based funding.
   - Implement vesting schedules for fund releases.
   - Add social sharing and IPFS for campaign media.

5. **Improved UX**:
   - Add pagination, search, and sorting for campaigns.
   - Display detailed campaign pages with progress bars.

6. **Testing and Auditing**:
   - Write comprehensive unit and integration tests.
   - Perform security audits and fuzz testing.

## Conclusion  

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve built a decentralized crowdfunding dApp powered by ink! smart contracts and a modern React/Next.js frontend. You can now create campaigns, contribute to them, and view progress â€” all secured by the blockchain.  

But this is just the beginning. Try extending the project with multi-asset support, better UX, or advanced security patterns. Contribute your version to the community, share your learnings, and help grow the ink! ecosystem.  

Happy coding, and see you on-chain ðŸš€
